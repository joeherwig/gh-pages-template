# gh-pages-template
A small single-page-template for quick creation of responsive gh-pages.

## Advantages
I wanted to have a fast solution without the need of taking care about  responsiveness, li adding a menu li keeping a small footprint and fast loading time li getting it without any dependancies and libraries li installing any additional tools like jekyll etc.

p And i wanted to be able to edit the pages quite fast. :-)
